# Python Club

Welcome to Python Club! The name may be a little misleading, as I'm not going to be teaching purely python, but rather how to program in general. We will explore many different programming languages and their pros/cons, and you can decide what you like the most.

Head over to [Getting Started](getting_started/index.md) to set up your development environment.
