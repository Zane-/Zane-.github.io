# Lesson 1: The Tools of the Trade

The focus of Lesson 1 will be on the common tools developers use to enable productivity and ease-of-use. We will not start covering how to code until Lesson 2 because I want you to have a solid foundation on the tools you will often use when you start coding.

I have included brief descriptions of the lessons here, with a link to their `tldr` sections for a slightly-more detailed summary.

#### Lesson 1.1

In Lesson 1.1, we will explore the Linux command line and learn basic commands for managing files. [tldr](lesson_1_1.html#tldr)

#### Lesson 1.2

In Lesson 1.2, we will learn how to host our software projects remotely using a version control system, enabling file history, portability, and collaboration. [tldr](lesson_1_2.html#tldr)

#### Lesson 1.3

In Lesson 1.3, we will revisit the Linux command line and learn some new concepts as well as some tools to ease navigating the command line. [tldr](lesson_1_3.html#tldr)
